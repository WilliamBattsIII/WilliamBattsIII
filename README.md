Hello, my name is William Batts III. I write code and fiddle with electronics as a hobby.

I like lower-level programming, closer to the hardware, such as programming in C, writing code for microcontrollers, or doing OS development, as well as various other projects.
In addition to programming, I like running, reading various books, and listening to music.

This account is meant for personal use, but something a bit more formal compared to other, past profiles. I hope you find something interesting!
