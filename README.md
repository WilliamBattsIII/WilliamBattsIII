Hello, my name is William Batts III. I write code and fiddle with electronics as a hobby.
I like lower-level programming, closer to the hardware, such as programming in C, writing code for microcontrollers, or doing OS development, as well as various other projects.
This account is meant for personal use, but something a bit more formal compared to other, past profiles.
